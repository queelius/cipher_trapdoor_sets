\begin{abstract}
We present Hash-Based Oblivious Sets (HBOS), a practical framework for privacy-preserving set operations that combines cryptographic hash functions with probabilistic data structures. Unlike traditional approaches using fully homomorphic encryption or secure multi-party computation, HBOS achieves microsecond-scale performance by embracing approximate operations with explicitly managed error rates.

Our framework provides: (1) a systematic approach to propagating error bounds through composed set operations, (2) efficient Boolean and symmetric difference operations on hash-transformed data with quantifiable false positive rates, and (3) practical implementations of privacy-preserving primitives including private set intersection and secure aggregation. We build upon established techniques from probabilistic data structures (Bloom filters, HyperLogLog) while adding cryptographic privacy through one-way hash transformations.

Experimental evaluation demonstrates that HBOS operations complete in 0.4-2.1 microseconds for typical workloads, offering 1000-10000× speedup over homomorphic encryption approaches. The framework provides privacy guarantees bounded by the collision probability of the underlying hash function (e.g., $2^{-256}$ for SHA-256). We validate HBOS through implementations of private set intersection, secure deduplication, and federated learning aggregation, showing practical applicability where approximate results with explicit error bounds are acceptable.

\section{Introduction}

The proliferation of cloud computing and data analytics has created an urgent need for privacy-preserving computational frameworks that enable operations on sensitive data without exposing the underlying values. Traditional approaches to this problem fall into two categories: cryptographic techniques such as fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)~\cite{gentry2009fully} and secure multi-party computation (MPC)~\cite{yao1982protocols}, and statistical techniques such as differential privacy~\cite{dwork2006calibrating}. While powerful, these approaches often suffer from computational overhead that limits their practical deployment.

We present Hash-Based Oblivious Sets (HBOS), a practical framework that achieves efficient privacy-preserving set operations by combining cryptographic hash functions with probabilistic data structures. Our approach differs from existing solutions by explicitly embracing approximation, making error rates transparent throughout the computational pipeline. This design choice enables HBOS to achieve microsecond-scale performance while providing privacy bounded by hash collision probabilities.

The core insight underlying HBOS is that many real-world applications can tolerate controlled error rates in exchange for efficiency and privacy. By using cryptographic hash functions as one-way transformations, we map sensitive data into a hash domain where equality testing is preserved probabilistically while the original values remain computationally hidden. All subsequent operations work exclusively on these hash values, never requiring access to the plaintext. This approach builds upon well-established techniques from probabilistic data structures while adding cryptographic privacy guarantees.

\subsection{Motivating Example}

Consider a healthcare consortium where multiple hospitals need to identify patients enrolled in overlapping clinical trials without revealing their complete patient lists. Traditional approaches would require either: (1) a trusted third party to perform the intersection, violating privacy requirements, (2) homomorphic encryption with prohibitive computational costs, or (3) complex MPC protocols requiring multiple rounds of communication.

Using HBOS, each hospital can:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Transform patient identifiers using a shared cryptographic hash function
\item Perform set intersection directly on hash values
\item Obtain results with explicit error bounds (e.g., false positive rate < $2^{-256}$)
\item Complete the entire operation in milliseconds rather than minutes
\end{enumerate}

This example illustrates HBOS's key advantage: practical performance with quantifiable privacy guarantees.

\subsection{Contributions}

This paper makes the following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Systematic Error Propagation}: We provide a formal framework for propagating error bounds through composed set operations on hash-transformed data, enabling applications to reason about accuracy-privacy trade-offs.

\item \textbf{Practical Implementation}: We demonstrate that combining cryptographic hashing with probabilistic data structures achieves microsecond-scale performance for privacy-preserving set operations, offering 1000-10000× speedup over homomorphic encryption.

\item \textbf{Integration of Existing Techniques}: We show how established algorithms (Bloom filters, HyperLogLog) can be enhanced with cryptographic privacy guarantees through systematic application of hash transformations.

\item \textbf{Real-World Applications}: We validate HBOS through implementations of private set intersection, secure deduplication, and federated learning aggregation, demonstrating practical utility where approximate results are acceptable.

\item \textbf{Security Analysis}: We provide formal analysis showing that privacy is bounded by the collision probability of the underlying hash function, with explicit quantification of error rates.
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:background} provides background on cryptographic hash functions and threat model. Section~\ref{sec:design} presents the HBOS framework design and core abstractions. Section~\ref{sec:theory} develops the mathematical foundations and security analysis. Section~\ref{sec:implementation} describes our implementation and optimization techniques. Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} evaluates performance and security properties.

\section{Background and Threat Model}
\label{sec:background}

\subsection{Cryptographic Hash Functions}

A cryptographic hash function $H: \{0,1\}^* \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$ maps arbitrary-length inputs to fixed-size outputs while satisfying three key properties:

\begin{definition}[Preimage Resistance]
Given hash value $h$, finding any $x$ such that $H(x) = h$ requires $O(2^n)$ operations.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Second Preimage Resistance]
Given $x_1$, finding $x_2 \neq x_1$ such that $H(x_1) = H(x_2)$ requires $O(2^n)$ operations.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Collision Resistance]
Finding any pair $(x_1, x_2)$ where $x_1 \neq x_2$ and $H(x_1) = H(x_2)$ requires $O(2^{n/2})$ operations.
\end{definition}

HBOS leverages these properties to create one-way transformations that preserve equality testing probabilistically while preventing recovery of original values.

\subsection{Approximate Data Structures}

Approximate data structures trade perfect accuracy for improved space or time complexity. The canonical example is the Bloom filter~\cite{bloom1970space}, which supports membership queries with false positives but no false negatives. HBOS builds upon these well-established techniques, adding cryptographic privacy through hash transformations while maintaining explicit error bounds.

\begin{definition}[Approximate Boolean]
An approximate Boolean value is a tuple $(v, \epsilon_p, \epsilon_n)$ where $v \in \{true, false\}$ is the estimated value, $\epsilon_p$ is the false positive rate, and $\epsilon_n$ is the false negative rate.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Threat Model}

We consider an honest-but-curious adversary model where:
\begin{itemize}
\item Participants follow the protocol correctly but attempt to learn additional information
\item The adversary has access to hash values but cannot invert the hash function
\item The adversary may have auxiliary information about the data distribution
\item The cryptographic hash function is modeled as a random oracle
\end{itemize}

We explicitly exclude:
\begin{itemize}
\item Malicious adversaries who deviate from the protocol
\item Side-channel attacks on the implementation
\item Quantum adversaries (though post-quantum hash functions could be used)
\end{itemize}

\section{System Design}
\label{sec:design}

\subsection{Core Abstractions}

HBOS is built around three core abstractions that compose to enable complex privacy-preserving operations:

\subsubsection{Hash-Oblivious Values}

A hash-oblivious value encapsulates the one-way transformation of sensitive data through cryptographic hashing. The key insight is that equality testing on hash values preserves the equality relation probabilistically while preventing recovery of original values. The false positive rate equals the collision probability of the hash function (e.g., $2^{-256}$ for SHA-256). Implementation details are provided in Appendix A.

\subsubsection{Approximate Values}

All operations in HBOS return approximate values with explicit error rates. Each approximate value maintains both the computed result and its associated false positive and false negative rates. This design makes uncertainty explicit and enables informed decision-making about accuracy-privacy trade-offs. The confidence in a result equals $1 - \epsilon_p - \epsilon_n$ where $\epsilon_p$ and $\epsilon_n$ are the false positive and negative rates respectively.

\subsubsection{Set Operations}

HBOS provides two primary set implementations with different algebraic properties:

\textbf{Boolean Sets} support full Boolean algebra:
\begin{itemize}
\item Union: $A \cup B$ with error propagation
\item Intersection: $A \cap B$ with error composition
\item Complement: $\neg A$ with error inversion
\item Membership: $x \in A$ with hash collision probability
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Symmetric Difference Sets} form a group under XOR:
\begin{itemize}
\item XOR: $A \oplus B$ for disjoint unions
\item Identity: Empty set
\item Inverse: Every set is its own inverse
\item Efficient for aggregation operations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Error Propagation}

A key aspect of HBOS is systematic error propagation through operations. For Boolean operations, we derive tight bounds:

\begin{theorem}[Union Error Bound]
For sets $A$ and $B$ with false positive rates $\epsilon_A$ and $\epsilon_B$:
$$\epsilon_{A \cup B} \leq \epsilon_A + \epsilon_B - \epsilon_A \cdot \epsilon_B$$
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Intersection Error Bound]
For sets $A$ and $B$ with false positive rates $\epsilon_A$ and $\epsilon_B$:
$$\epsilon_{A \cap B} \leq \min(\epsilon_A, \epsilon_B)$$
\end{theorem}

These bounds enable applications to predict error accumulation through complex operations.

\subsection{Architecture}

HBOS follows a layered architecture as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:architecture}:

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Applications} \\
(PSI, Analytics, Aggregation) \\

(SHA-256, BLAKE2b, etc.) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{HBOS layered architecture}
\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

This design enables modularity and allows applications to work at the appropriate abstraction level.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}
\label{sec:theory}

\subsection{Security Analysis}

We formalize HBOS's security properties using the random oracle model for hash functions.

\begin{definition}[One-Wayness Game]
The one-wayness game $\mathcal{G}_{OW}$ between challenger $\mathcal{C}$ and adversary $\mathcal{A}$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mathcal{C}$ selects random $x \in \{0,1\}^*$ and key $k$
\item $\mathcal{C}$ computes $h = H(k||x)$ and sends $h$ to $\mathcal{A}$
\item $\mathcal{A}$ outputs $x'$
\item $\mathcal{A}$ wins if $x' = x$
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Privacy Preservation]
Let $H: \{0,1\}^* \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$ be a random oracle. For any PPT adversary $\mathcal{A}$, the probability of winning $\mathcal{G}_{OW}$ is negligible:
$$\Pr[\mathcal{A} \text{ wins } \mathcal{G}_{OW}] \leq 2^{-n} + \text{negl}(n)$$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
In the random oracle model, $H(k||x)$ is uniformly distributed over $\{0,1\}^n$. Without knowledge of $k$, the adversary's view is independent of $x$, reducing to random guessing with success probability $2^{-n}$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Approximate Algebraic Properties}

HBOS exhibits approximate algebraic properties with explicit error bounds:

\begin{definition}[Approximate Set Operations]
For hash-transformed sets $H(A)$ and $H(B)$, operations preserve set relationships probabilistically:
\begin{itemize}
\item Union: $H(A) \cup H(B) \approx H(A \cup B)$ with error $\epsilon \leq 2^{-n}$
\item Intersection: $H(A) \cap H(B) \approx H(A \cap B)$ with error $\epsilon \leq 2^{-n}$
\item Symmetric difference: $H(A) \oplus H(B) = H(A \triangle B)$ (exact for disjoint sets)
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\textbf{Important Note}: These are \emph{not} true homomorphic properties as operations are approximate with collision-bounded error rates. The framework provides practical privacy-preserving computation where approximate results are acceptable.

\subsection{Cardinality Estimation}

HBOS incorporates the well-established HyperLogLog algorithm~\cite{flajolet2007hyperloglog} for cardinality estimation on hash-transformed sets. We apply HyperLogLog without modification, leveraging its proven accuracy guarantees:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Cardinality Estimation}
\label{alg:cardinality}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE Trapdoor set $S$
\ENSURE Estimated cardinality $\hat{n}$
\STATE $m \leftarrow$ number of buckets
\STATE $M \leftarrow$ array of $m$ registers
\FOR{each trapdoor $t \in S$}
  \STATE $j \leftarrow$ first $\log_2 m$ bits of $t$
  \STATE $w \leftarrow$ remaining bits of $t$
  \STATE $M[j] \leftarrow \max(M[j], \rho(w))$
\ENDFOR
\STATE $\hat{n} \leftarrow \alpha_m \cdot m^2 / \sum_{j=1}^{m} 2^{-M[j]}$
\RETURN $\hat{n}$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The algorithm achieves relative error $1.04/\sqrt{m}$ using $O(m \log \log n)$ bits.

\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

We implemented HBOS as a header-only C++20 library, leveraging modern language features for type safety and performance. The implementation uses template metaprogramming for compile-time optimization and C++20 concepts for type constraints. We employ several optimization techniques including SIMD instructions for batch hashing, memory pooling for allocation efficiency, and cache-aligned data structures.

The library provides flexible key management supporting key derivation for different contexts, periodic key rotation, and threshold secret sharing for distributed deployments. Implementation details including code structure, optimization techniques, and API design are provided in Appendix A.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

We evaluate CTS on:
\begin{itemize}
\item Intel Core i9-12900K (16 cores, 24 threads)
\item 64GB DDR5 RAM
\item Ubuntu 22.04, GCC 12.2
\item Compiled with -O3 -march=native
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Benchmarks}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Operation Latency (microseconds)}
\label{tab:performance}
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\toprule
Operation & Mean & Std Dev \\
\midrule
Trapdoor creation & 0.42 & 0.03 \\
Set insertion (1K elements) & 420 & 12 \\
Set membership test & 0.45 & 0.02 \\
Set intersection (1K each) & 892 & 28 \\
Set union (1K each) & 856 & 24 \\
Cardinality estimation & 1.2 & 0.1 \\
Jaccard similarity & 2.1 & 0.2 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

CTS achieves microsecond-scale performance for common operations, making it suitable for real-time applications.

\subsection{Scalability Analysis}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\begin{lstlisting}[language={},basicstyle=\scriptsize\ttfamily,frame=none]
Throughput (ops/sec) vs Set Size
10^7 |       *
     |     *
10^6 |   *
     | *
10^5 |*_____________
     10^2  10^4  10^6
        Set Size
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Throughput scaling with set size}
\label{fig:scalability}
\end{figure}

Throughput remains constant for small sets and decreases logarithmically for large sets due to cache effects.

\subsection{Security Evaluation}

We validate security properties through:

\textbf{Collision Testing}: No collisions found in $2^{40}$ random inputs with 256-bit hashes.

\textbf{Statistical Analysis}: Output distributions pass NIST randomness tests.

\textbf{Timing Analysis}: Operations exhibit constant-time behavior preventing timing attacks.

\subsection{Comparison with Alternatives}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Comparison with Related Systems}
\label{tab:comparison}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
System & Privacy & Performance & Accuracy \\
\midrule
HBOS (This work) & High & Microseconds & Approximate \\
FHE & Perfect & Seconds & Exact \\
MPC & High & Milliseconds & Exact \\
Bloom Filters & None & Microseconds & Approximate \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

HBOS occupies a unique position offering cryptographic privacy with practical performance by accepting controlled approximation.

\section{Applications}
\label{sec:applications}

\subsection{Private Set Intersection}

HBOS enables efficient PSI without revealing non-matching elements. The intersection operation on hash-transformed sets achieves $O(n)$ complexity compared to $O(n^2)$ for naive approaches. The false positive rate is bounded by the hash collision probability, providing strong privacy guarantees for practical applications.

\subsection{Secure Deduplication}

Cloud storage providers can identify duplicate files without accessing content:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Secure Deduplication}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE File $F$, Trapdoor factory $T$
\STATE $chunks \leftarrow$ split $F$ into blocks
\STATE $hashes \leftarrow$ empty set
\FOR{each chunk $c \in chunks$}
  \STATE $h \leftarrow T.create(c)$
  \STATE add $h$ to $hashes$
\ENDFOR
\STATE Query storage for existing $hashes$
\STATE Upload only unique chunks
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Privacy-Preserving Analytics}

HBOS supports various analytical operations on hash-transformed data:

\textbf{Histogram Generation}: Count occurrences without revealing underlying values, useful for distribution analysis while preserving privacy.

\textbf{Frequency Analysis}: Identify common patterns in hash-transformed data with collision-bounded error rates.

\textbf{Similarity Metrics}: Compute Jaccard similarity and other set-based metrics on private sets with explicit error quantification.

\subsection{Federated Learning}

HBOS supports secure aggregation in federated learning by allowing participants to submit hash-transformed model updates. The server aggregates these oblivious updates using symmetric difference operations, revealing only the final aggregate while preserving individual update privacy. This approach is particularly effective when combined with differential privacy for additional statistical guarantees.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

\subsection{Homomorphic Encryption}

Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables arbitrary computation on encrypted data. Since Gentry's breakthrough~\cite{gentry2009fully}, significant progress has been made in practical FHE systems. TFHE~\cite{chillotti2020tfhe} and CKKS~\cite{cheon2017homomorphic} achieve sub-second bootstrapping, while recent work on fully homomorphic encryption over the integers~\cite{brakerski2022fully} simplifies implementation. However, FHE still incurs 1000-10000× overhead for general computation. Partially homomorphic schemes like Paillier~\cite{paillier1999public} offer better performance but support only specific operations. HBOS provides a complementary approach, achieving microsecond performance by accepting approximate results rather than exact homomorphic computation.

\subsection{Secure Multi-Party Computation}

MPC protocols enable joint computation without revealing inputs. Classical protocols~\cite{yao1982protocols, goldreich1987play} laid theoretical foundations, while modern frameworks have made MPC practical. MP-SPDZ~\cite{keller2020mp} provides a comprehensive toolkit supporting multiple protocols, while ABY3~\cite{mohassel2018aby3} achieves efficient three-party computation. Recent advances in silent OT~\cite{boyle2022cheaper} and function secret sharing~\cite{boyle2021function} have reduced communication complexity. However, MPC still requires multiple rounds of interaction and coordination between parties. HBOS operates non-interactively using only hash transformations, trading exact computation for practical single-party performance.

\subsection{Private Set Intersection}

PSI protocols have evolved significantly since early work~\cite{meadows1986more, freedman2004efficient}. Modern protocols achieve remarkable efficiency: OPRF-based PSI~\cite{raghuraman2022blazing} handles billion-element sets, while circuit-PSI~\cite{chandran2022circuit} enables arbitrary computations on intersection results. Unbalanced PSI~\cite{chen2022blazing} optimizes for asymmetric set sizes common in practice. Recent work on PSI from pseudorandom correlation generators~\cite{schoppmann2023psi} achieves optimal communication. HBOS provides a simpler alternative where approximate results are acceptable, requiring only hash computation without cryptographic protocols.

\subsection{Approximate Data Structures}

Probabilistic data structures trade accuracy for efficiency. Bloom filters~\cite{bloom1970space} pioneered this approach for membership testing. Cuckoo filters~\cite{fan2014cuckoo} improve on Bloom filters by supporting deletions. Count-Min sketches~\cite{cormode2005improved} and Count-HyperLogLog~\cite{ting2020count} enable frequency and cardinality estimation. Recent work includes learned Bloom filters~\cite{kraska2018case} using machine learning to optimize performance, and XOR filters~\cite{graf2020xor} achieving near-optimal space efficiency. HBOS builds upon these foundations, adding cryptographic privacy through hash transformations while maintaining the efficiency benefits of approximate operations.

\subsection{Differential Privacy}

Differential privacy (DP)~\cite{dwork2006calibrating} provides statistical privacy guarantees through calibrated noise addition. The field has matured significantly with deployment at major tech companies~\cite{erlingsson2014rappor, apple2017differential}. Recent advances include the exponential mechanism~\cite{mcsherry2021exponential}, concentrated DP~\cite{bun2016concentrated} for tighter privacy accounting, and shuffle DP~\cite{erlingsson2019amplification} amplifying privacy through anonymization. Private aggregation techniques~\cite{bonawitz2021practical} enable federated learning at scale. HBOS provides complementary cryptographic privacy that can be composed with DP techniques, offering defense-in-depth for sensitive applications.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented Hash-Based Oblivious Sets (HBOS), a practical framework for privacy-preserving set operations that combines cryptographic hash functions with probabilistic data structures. By explicitly managing error rates and embracing approximation, HBOS achieves microsecond-scale performance while providing privacy bounded by hash collision probabilities.

Our contributions include:
\begin{itemize}
\item A systematic framework for error propagation through composed set operations on hash-transformed data
\item Integration of established probabilistic algorithms (Bloom filters, HyperLogLog) with cryptographic privacy guarantees
\item Practical demonstrations achieving 1000-10000× speedup over homomorphic encryption approaches
\item Validation through real-world applications in private set intersection, secure aggregation, and federated learning
\end{itemize}

Future directions include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Integration with post-quantum hash functions for quantum resistance
\item Hardware acceleration leveraging AES-NI and SHA extensions
\item Composition with differential privacy for enhanced protection
\item Formal verification of implementation correctness
\end{itemize}

HBOS demonstrates that practical privacy-preserving computation is achievable when applications can accept approximate results with explicit error bounds. The framework provides a valuable tool for scenarios where the trade-off between perfect accuracy and practical performance favors efficiency.

    return hmac_sha256(master_key_,
                       context);
  }

  // Periodic key rotation
  void rotate_keys() {
    auto new_key = generate_random_key();
    secure_overwrite(master_key_);
    master_key_ = new_key;
  }

  // Shamir's secret sharing
  auto split_key(int threshold, int shares) {

  }
};
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{C++20 Concepts}

We use concepts for compile-time type checking:

concept Hashable = requires(T t) {
  { std::hash<T>{}(t) } ->
    std::convertible_to<size_t>;

    std::convertible_to<approximate_bool>;
};
\end{lstlisting}

Leveraging C++20 parallel algorithms:

auto parallel_union(const S& a, const S& b) {
  S result;
  std::for_each(
    std::execution::par_unseq,
    a.begin(), a.end(),
    [&result](const auto& elem) {
      result.insert(elem);
    });
  std::for_each(
    std::execution::par_unseq,
    b.begin(), b.end(),
    [&result](const auto& elem) {
      result.insert(elem);
    });
  return result;
}
\end{lstlisting}
