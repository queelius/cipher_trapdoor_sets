## Getting Started

### Installation

Since this is a header-only library, installation is simple:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/queelius/cipher_trapdoor_sets.git

# Include in your project
# Add to your include path: cipher_trapdoor_sets/include
```

### Your First Program

Create a file `hello_trapdoor.cpp`:

```cpp
#include <cipher_trapdoor_sets/cts.hpp>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace cts;

int main() {
    // Create a trapdoor factory with a secret key
    trapdoor_factory<32> factory("my-secret-key");

    // Transform sensitive data into trapdoors
    auto alice = factory.create(std::string("alice@example.com"));
    auto bob = factory.create(std::string("bob@example.com"));

    // Compare trapdoors (approximate equality)
    auto result = (alice == bob);

    std::cout << "Are they the same? " << result.value() << "\n";
    std::cout << "False positive rate: " << result.false_positive_rate() << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

Compile and run:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -I/path/to/cipher_trapdoor_sets/include hello_trapdoor.cpp -o hello_trapdoor
./hello_trapdoor
```
